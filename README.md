# Neural Collaborative Filtering-Movie Recommendation System

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Neural collaborative filtering(NCF), is a deep learning based framework for making reccomendations.The key idea is to learn user-item interactions using neural network
and predict the rating of unrated movies.

## PAPER REFERED
This project is implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf) 

## DATA:
We will be using a The Movie dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from the Kaggle platform which has a very good collection of datasets.
